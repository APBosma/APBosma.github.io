            Assuming you are not using a database, I would recommend using Github pages. All you need for this is a Github account.
            To create a Github pages, you need to create a repository named your username followed by ".github.io" and then publish it.
            Put all of your files in this repository. To see your website, put the name of your repository in your search bar. this 
            website actually uses Github pages.

            Another option is Neocities. I am not as familiar with Neocities, but it is another free option to host a basic website.
            There are many fantastic websites hosted through Neocities and I have heard a lot of good things about it previously.
