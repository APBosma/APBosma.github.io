        <h2>Hi, I'm Adele Bosma</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior at Concord University working on my bachelors in computer science with a concentration in software 
          development. I will be graduating the spring of 2026. I love creating software, especially when it helps people in 
          their day to day life. Throughout my portfolio, you will be able to see how I have worked to help people with my code.
