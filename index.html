        <ol>
          <li>Current Concord students only.</li>
          <li>Stay appropriate. If you wouldn't talk about it with Professor Bowe, then pick a different topic.</li>
          <li>
            If you intend to use a LLM, use it responsibly. Needing help with syntax and having it write your code for you
            are two very different things. We will know if you used an LLM to write everything. Don't cheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submit a link, not files. This will make sure we don't accidentally lose a file and misjudge your work. 
            Please see <a href = "submission.html">Submission Info</a> for information on how to do this for free if you 
            don't know how.
